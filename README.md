This application is a task administrator system. The system will allow a user to create new tasks, assign 
them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to belong to. They can use a text based user 
interface via the command-line. The user is able to edit,mark as done or remove tasks. They can also quit 
and save the current task list to file, and then restart the application with the former state restored.
